These four files contain the bare skeletal outline for how I accomplished a custom UITableViewCell that would 
expand when selected to reveal two buttons, each with a function unique to the cell. This code has been adapted 
from a previous project and *has not been tested*. I have uploaded it merely as a reference, since code for 
dynamically expanding cell views seems to be very sought-after on StackOverflow.
